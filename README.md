# Introduction

tui is a reusable asyncio library to provide scrolling terminal output, but
with editor support.

I _really_ liked OpenAI Codex's TUI, and decided to use coding agents to give
me the same in Nim.

It did a pretty good job, but still needed handholding.  Occasionally it went
off the rails, and I had to revert, clear the session, and continue.  Both
Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 Codex are pretty amazing, while GPT-5 mini is great
for smaller changes.  I created AGENTS.md along the way to help it play nicer
with Nim.
